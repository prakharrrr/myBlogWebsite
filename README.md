# myBlogWebsite
A personal blog website for people to log their daily ideas, plans and experiences. Once we log our entries from the compose page, we get sent back to the hoe page
where a compilation of all of our entries till date are displayed. Each entry contains a "Read more" button which relays us to a page displaying the entirety of that
particular daily log. These complete versions of our posts are rendered using EJS layouts and templates. Further, on our main page, we have the option of deleting a 
particular pre-written post. The project also required a database so as to ensure that our posts are not deleted everytime we restart our server. This has been done
using Mongoose which is used to interact with our MongoDB database. The backend has been made using Node.js and its framework Express. The frontend has been 
made using JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
